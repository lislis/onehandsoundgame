# OneHandSoundGame
My hack for the Web Audio Hackday at Soundcloud 2014

## How do I play it?

Place your left hand on your keyboard.
Your thumb goes on the space bar, pressing it will shoot.
Your other fingers go on the numbers 1 through 4. Pressing them will highlight different wave types.

Once a wave type is highlighted, shoot it with the space bar!
